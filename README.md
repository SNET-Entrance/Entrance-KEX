# Entrance-KEX

Key EXchange Service. A python service for storing secret ABE keys per user. This service enables different software clients (WebBrowser or e.g. a native Windows C# Client) to use the same secret ABE key. The clients have to use the OAuth 2 procotol to get the user-specific ABE key for a decryption.
